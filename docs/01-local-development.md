# Lab 1: Local development workflow

## 1.1 - Installing the application dependencies
Once you've forked and cloned this repository on your computer, navigate to the root directory of the application and open the project in your code editor (for example, VS Code with `code .`).    

In the terminal of your code editor, install all project dependencies using:
```sh
npm install
```

## 1.2 - Let's try our local development workflow

[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm), which we'll use in this tutorial as our build tool, allows you to define automated tasks in the package.json file.   
In this file, in the `scripts` section, you will see that some tasks are already defined:

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
  },
  ```

To build the react application, we can simply tell `npm `to do so:

```sh
npm run build
```

This application contains one unit test. Let's make sure it is passing:

```sh
npm run test
```

If we want to deploy the application in the local environment in development mode, we can simply run:

```sh
npm start
```

and then open http://localhost:3000 to check our web application.

## Lab checklist

- [x] Read the instructions
- [ ] Install the application dependencies
- [ ] Build the application locally
- [ ] Run the unit test locally
- [ ] Deploy the application locally in development mode
